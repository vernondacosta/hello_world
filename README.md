# hello_world
My first repository on GitHub.

My name is Vernon DaCosta. I am 39 years old. I have recently decided to become a professional independent Technical Writer. I have two clients currently. I will participate in developing documentation for open source and freeware software products to build a portfolio and greater experience. I will briefly intern with a number of Silicon Valley startups to grow my network. I will slowly build a dedicated clientele and a far reaching professional netwok. I will do the necessary work and be successful.
